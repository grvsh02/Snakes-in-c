# Snakes-in-c

## Atlas-in-c

A simple game of snakes with a beautiful ui.
Prerequisites

- gcc compiler
- graphics.h installed and configured
- The program is configured with respect to a 1980x1080 monitor. Monitor screens with some other screen size may have some issues where boders may lay out of the screen, please consider changing the screen size in code line 12.

The game is self explanatory, you need to feed the snake with the apples appearing on the screen. The more you eat more is the length of the snake and more is the speed. Enjoy ðŸ˜„
